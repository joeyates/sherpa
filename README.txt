Introduction
-------------
Sherpa is a cross-platform file browser.

The application is aimed to be usable on:
* Windows 2000/XP,
* GNU/Linux,
* (and other systems as they get sorted out)

The main aim of the Sherpa project is to create
a file browser that is easy to use and flexible,
allowing configuration to match the expectations
of users as they move from operating system to
operating system.

Users
------
The project aims to create a program that will
aid the non-technical desktop user to handle
common file activities on any operating system.

A user who is accustomed to using Windows' Explorer
will find it easier to switch to Linux (and
handle Mac OS X when they have to) if file access
is presented in a similar manner.
